# Shallot-Monitoring-System-with-Fuzzy
This is a repository of my final project which is designing a monitoring system that can help farmers to prevent fusarium wilt using IoT and fuzzy logic by monitoring 4 parameters which is Air Temperature, Air Humidity, Soil Humidity and Soil pH. The devices in the field called "ESP-Slave" will send the data usign ESP-NOW Protocol to ESP-Master to be processed in Raspberry Pi using Node-RED as the programming language and give output in a form of whatsapp notification and solenoic water valve opening.
